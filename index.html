    <h3>Who I am</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm Jameshia! I'm a mother of a four-year-old. I love to cook! I really like the internal details of computers, and I like to fix computers too. My time spent with computers has given me a passion to learn more about them, and I have taken a special interest in coding. I have really enjoyed solving coding challenges and I love the "I got it!!" moments. I would love to code something with you. Let's make something great together!</p>
    <p>I live in Atlanta, Georgia. Go Falcons!</p>

<div class="about_me">
    <h3>What I do</h3>
    <p>I have a passion for web development. You can make a really grand and wonderful picture from many small pieces. I like watching the page come together one small piece at a time. Then I look back and see a bigger picture that forms a web page, much like the one you are viewing now!</p>    
    <p>When I'm not spending time coding, I like to play with my dog Ace. I also enjoy listening to music in my free time.</p>
